# Post-installation for Fedora

This repository contains scripts that autoinstalls and autoconfigures my fresh installed system.

Originally, scripts should be run on Fedora. This repository will be expanded from time to time, so, mb I will add a more GNU/Linux distributions support.

## Installation

```sh
curl -s -L git.io/in.sh | sh
```
