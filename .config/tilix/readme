MIGRATING SETTINGS

This directory contains color schemes for Tilix (installed by Gogh, link: https://mayccoll.github.io/Gogh/).
Schemes will automatically imported and there's no additional things to do.

Also I dumped file of my Tilix configuration.
Optional, use instructions below to load it.

* Export settings from Tilix using dconf utility

$ dconf dump /com/gexperts/Tilix/ > tilix.dconf

* Import dump file to apply configuration settings

$ dconf load /com/gexperts/Tilix/ < tilix.dconf
