This repository contains scripts that autoinstalls and autoconfigures my fresh installed system.

Originally, scripts should be run on Fedora. This repository will be expanded from time to time, so, mb I will add a more GNU/Linux distributions support.

Installation
------------
The laziest way is run one of the following:

     # for curl
     sh <(curl -fsSL git.io/in.sh)

     # for wget
     sh <(wget -qO- git.io/in.sh)

You could install script locally and then run, for example:

     curl -LO git.io/in.sh
     sh in.sh

That's it.
